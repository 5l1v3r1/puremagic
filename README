puremagic is a pure python module that will identify a file based off it's
magic numbers. It is designed to be minimalistic and inherently cross platform
compatible, with no imports when used as a module. However this does come at the
price of being incomplete. It is also designed to be a stand in for python-magic,
it incorporates the functions from_file(filename[, mime]) and
from_string(string[, mime]) however the magic_file() and magic_string() are more
powerful and will also display confidence and duplicate matches.

Advantages over using a wrapper for 'file' or 'libmagic':
    - Fast (4x faster testing with a jpg image)
    - Lightweight (10x smaller compared to wrapper and 'file')
    - Cross platform compatible (no tweaking or adding dlls)
    - Minimal (less than 50 lines of logic)
    
Disadvantages:
    - Not as powerful (Cannot identify nearly as many files)
    - May contain errors (I'm not perfect, and some file have only one or two
        byte magic numbers.)
        
Compatibility:
    Python 2.6+ (including 3.x)
    Python 2.4-2.7 if you removing the byte notation before each hex string
        (Version testing and automatic handling could be done with code,
            however it would slow the process down or require imports.)

    The unit tests are currently only being developed for python 2.7
        
Usage:
    import puremagic
    ext = puremagic.from_file(filename)

Script:
    puremagic.py [options] filename <filename2>...
    
Practical Example:   
    import puremagic
    
    filename = "/path/unknownfile"
    
    try:
        filename += puremagic.from_file(filename)
    except LookupError:
        filename += ".txt"
